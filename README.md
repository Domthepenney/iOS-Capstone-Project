## Overview
### Description
SnapHabit is a visual habit tracker that holds users accountable through photography. Instead of just checking a box, users must take a photo to prove they completed their daily task (e.g., a photo of running shoes, a finished book, or a healthy meal).

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity / Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Uses the **Camera** (essential feature) and **Push Notifications**. The app is designed for quick, on-the-go interactions.
- **Story:** "Pics or it didn't happen." Creates a visual diary of your progress, which is more motivating than a simple spreadsheet.
- **Market:** Anyone trying to build a new habit (students, fitness enthusiasts, hobbyists).
- **Habit:** Daily usage is required to maintain streaks, creating a high-retention loop.
- **Scope:** V1 is very achievable: A list of habits, a camera view, and a "history" view.
